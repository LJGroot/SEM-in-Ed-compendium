# Longitudinal Factor Analysis

With longitudinal factor analysis, a factor model is fitted to a set of indicators of which responses are collected at different time points. It may be interesting to compare factor means and variance across time. 

Fitting a longitudinal factor model is not very different from fitting a factor model with means, except that in a longitudinal factor model there are covariances between the residual factors of the same indicator at different time points. Figure 1 depicts a one-factor model of “Self-efficacy” with six indicators, measured at two different time points. Because each indicator is measured twice in the same individuals, the item specific components of each indicator covary across timepoints.
